It's just a movement acceptance invoice, nothing interesting, <PlayerName>.

This is one of the crazy laws issued by the twenty-second Subsistence Council, requiring all harvestable crops<LINE>to be harvested before final public ascension. For those individuals who hoped to delay their ascent, this was not<LINE>very kind!<LINE>At the time, they used any means to unify their pace when plunging into the Void Sea. But upon closer examination,<LINE>there was an obvious greed hidden behind this obsession. Fortunately, the Void Sea is not a strict judge.

This is a memory about a family portrait. The original intention was to attract families of the same caste<LINE>- aristocrats, you know - to gather together for warmth.<LINE>But it is obvious that this is either a clumsy imitation or a satire. My feeling is that although our creators<LINE>were extremely rigid, sometimes they were also unexpectedly funny.

This is a catalog of components for sky-sail joinery. If you don't understand what a sky-sail is, you can try<LINE>imagining a mini version of a vulture.<LINE>Don't show such complicated expressions!<LINE>If it makes you feel better, those sky-sails are much more harmless than vultures. Our creators<LINE>shifted too much attention to ascent, so the research on sky-sails stopped at entertainment purposes.

This poor person was trying to imitate the classical style of writing. He needed to do this, as some ideas can only<LINE>exist in specific forms.<LINE>But unfortunately, the old era has become a thing of the past. He wrote well, but no one can listen anymore.

This is a blueprint for some building support beams. Eh, there's nothing interesting about it.

This is a schematic of a purposed organism. I guess you've encountered these guys while passing by the<LINE>garbage dump. But this was an early version, which means it wouldn't get angry when attacked yet. When<LINE>our creators designed these things, they could always turn biological instincts into an advantage for them. How cunning~

This is an old schematic for a gas filtration machine, which looks very roughly crafted<LINE>and the design needs improvement.

This is the genome of a sulfur-processing microbe. This version had already been phased out.

It's the blueprint for a small incense purification filter. A necessity for my creators to live on superstructures.

A model of a fluid carrying pipe section. I guess you don't really need this, nor do I.

You've found something rare! This is a simple diamond sphere, and upon closer inspection,<LINE>you can see the difference between it and pearls. Take it to collect, kid.

Hmm... Someone abused this pearl. This type of engraving does not seem to have been done by scavengers,<LINE>nor does it seem to have been mechanically engraved. But it has been engraved back and forth thousands of<LINE>times, and it feels like the obsession is deeper than an echo. However, even if it really comes from our creators,<LINE>it's hard to surprise me!

This pearl has been damaged and is no longer useful to us. However, scavengers will definitely like it,<LINE>and you can exchange it with them.

There is only one blurry image inside... a strip of fabric? This pearl has faded, so I cannot<LINE>tell you more information.

This is a compact creative work! The producer did not use any data format to record information, but<LINE>directly drew a complex pattern inside its lattice. In other words, they made a micro sculpture. I'm glad<LINE>to see such an interesting creation. Thank you, <PlayerName>.

This pearl has faded severely, leaving only some unreadable garbled characters inside.

Oh... I hate to say it, but you brought a completely blank pearl!

Okay, this one is completely empty.

Completely blank - it is just waiting for someone to write on it. Unfortunately, no one has done so yet.

I have an unfortunate news to tell you: there are no interesting stories or practical skills<LINE>in this pearl. Actually, there's nothing here!

This one has nothing - not even a symbol.

Empty and empty! However, you can take it to play. After all, it is a beautiful sphere.

It is already broken and cannot read anything.

This is an infinitely nested pearl image. Are you curious about what it symbolizes? But we can't tell anymore.<LINE>It may symbolize eternal cycle, which is the least fresh topic in ancient civilization. But it's more likely that it's just a small joke.<LINE>It's not much use, just go play with it~

"...through the mists of memory, your image dances, like the motes of dust, in a ray of sunlight, that<LINE>pierces a dark room."<LINE>It is a line of verse from the ancient farmer-poet Pel. He had the wonderful ability to describe abstract<LINE>experiences! If you bring me a few more of his works, <PlayerName>, I might feel like lying on the<LINE>ground and passionately telling you about my past.<LINE>Haha, you aren't taking this seriously, I hope? 

This is a catalog of tea brewing techniques. Most of the raw materials were very rare and went extinct<LINE>with the ascension of the creators. Unfortunately, you can't taste the freshness anymore.

Such a strange list... Can this be some kind of ritual preparation material?

Little one, you have dug up a real treasure of art! Don't worry, I will try to describe it to you.<LINE>In the painting, there is a filter feeding plant that has been thirsty for a long time, with five bottles of water placed on its surface.<LINE>Many of our creators claimed that this painting caused them physiological pain.<LINE>In the era of the strictest bans, distribution was even banned at one point.<LINE>Perhaps you can empathize with their desires, but it's difficult to understand their struggles. Believe me, this<LINE>is exactly what makes you cute!

This is an excerpt from a classical long poem. This poetry is particularly ancient, and the author chose to remain anonymous.<LINE>I remember he recounted his eleven suicides and cycles, and gave an exceptionally pessimistic prophecy at the end.<LINE>The excerpt here is a heavy and tedious reasoning...<LINE>I guess you're already drowsy from listening, little one~

There are 71 numbers here, it's hard to guess their purpose!

Let's keep this pearl a secret. Some things are not suitable for you to listen to, nor are they suitable for me to say.

This pearl records a simple hymn. Hey, even if you stare at me like this, I can't sing to you~<LINE>Alright, I'll try to find a way to play it.

"Dear diary..." Then there was no more.

This is a diary written by an underground construction worker. He wrote extensively about his insomnia<LINE>and nightmares.<LINE>During that period, people were anxiously striving to unveil the veil of the void sea.<LINE>Simultaneously giving birth to a subgenre of classic horror literature.<LINE>These diaries are obviously more documentary than fictional literature. It's very interesting. If you can<LINE>understand, I'm even willing to read it to you as a bedtime story~

This one originally recorded some simple geometric theories of the ancients. Now, I would say it records<LINE>the handicrafts of scavengers.<LINE>Their drilling technology has improved a lot, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. It's hard not<LINE>to wonder to what extent the scavenger tribes can evolve to after ten thousand cycles of rain.<LINE>Haha, from your expression, they are already tricky enough now, aren't they?

The data of this pearl has been scrambled multiple times. It may store some valuable confidential<LINE>information. Perhaps it is a business document? Of course, after our creators left, these secrets<LINE>became worthless.

This is a growing instruction for the skeleton of a creature. It looks about the same size as you,<LINE>but I would say you're much cuter, <PlayerName>.

There is nothing above except for the number 8. Um... Did anyone draw lots with pearls?

There's nothing interesting about this pearl, it just contains a numerical sequence. This may be a key<LINE>or identification code, but it is definitely invalid now.

This is a number series, which could be a kind of cipher.

This document records information about various weapons. But it's obvious that there hasn't been any new<LINE>weapons produced on this land for a long time - oh, let alone the rebar you're using. Throughout the history<LINE>of writing, our creators tended to use swords to symbolize rules and guards, rather than violent impulses.<LINE>This is very interesting, isn't it? It seems that the consequences of violence are quite frightening.

This is a journal that attempts to confuse the void fluids with antimatter. How imaginative! Our creators<LINE>always came up with some strange ideas. Sometimes I think they were trying to please the public, but they<LINE>were more likely to be just too excited.

This pearl's memory is occupied entirely by a completely blank image. This is quite interesting, I guess the creator<LINE>was expressing their reverence for nothingness. At least in the small pearl universe, he could create absolute tranquility.

How ambitious was the person who wrote this set of code?! His goal was to conduct complex simulations of our world.<LINE>Regardless of the final accuracy, the workload alone is staggering. Let me see......<LINE>Optimistically speaking, he had only completed less than 1%. This is an interesting attempt, but unfortunately public<LINE>ascension interrupted it. I guess many people had work that they didn't want to interrupt until the end, but no one<LINE>could tolerate loneliness. So even if someone tried to stay, in the end, we are still the only ones left.

It records a special language that transmits information through gestures and facial expressions. Do you<LINE>want to learn?<LINE>I can complete the gesture part, you can use emojis. No need for triple affirmation anymore! I don't mind leaving<LINE>some time to practice this with you.
