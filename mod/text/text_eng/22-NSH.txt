This is a chat record of our local group. Perhaps looking back on the past is<LINE>also my duty - since you brought it to me.

During that period, the extreme radicalism of Five Pebbles caused anxiety among many members.<LINE>In this conversation, I openly expressed my attitude, hoping that he could see the absurdity of his position.

I didn't consider the words and phrases at that time. Now it seems that when it comes to<LINE>the issue of Five Pebbles, I always lose my judgement because it upsets me.

But in fact, this approach would only have a counterproductive effect on the obsessed ones.

<PlayerName>, is your expression expecting me to say more?

I am not inclined to speak eloquently about a tragedy... or rather,<LINE>the shock of this matter still leaves me unsure where to start.
